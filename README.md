# hello-world
starting a new adventure...

Hi!
I'm a planetary sciences graduate student making my way into the coding world. I know much about scientific programming and data processing in Matlab and IDL, and I have experience in instrumentation and automation with LabView, but I'm ready to explore what it takes to build apps, games, interactive websites, machine learning, and anything else that I stumble into. 

I will work my way through codeacademy.com and log my progress here.
